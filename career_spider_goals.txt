Goal - create a web crawler that does the following:
		1) goes to employer sites>careers
		1a) How to check for multiple sites, does this need to integrate into a webpage?
		2) look for particular job types
		3) extract data points
		4) copy data points to a database (google forms)
		5) collect corresponding salary data for job

Short Term / Long Term
  store results in file (text then CSV) / store in DB
  site names are static / site names are prompted
  initial search for site will look for careers page
  next search will look for openings or posting, additionally externally hosted sites
  Final search will be extracting the jobs specifically / asking for input on job title
    ?Can this cross reference or search indeed first?
	Finessing would be adding error handling.
